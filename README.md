# Stroop Dataset

This GitHub repository contains a simple dataset of a Stroop experiment. Students in an introduction to psychology course completed named the colors in congruent trials (e.g., the word 'red' written in a red font) and incongruent trials (e.g., the word 'red' written in a green font). The time they took to name all words was recorded in seconds (e.g., 21.3 seconds) for both the congruent and incongruent blocks. 

There are four columns containing

1. Participant Number
2. Response Time for Congruent Stimuli
3. Response Time for Incongruent Stimuli
4. Year of Data Collection
